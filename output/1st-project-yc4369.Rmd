                                        months_3 = "3m", hours_24 = "24h"))
```


### Question 1. Gender and Marrige
Are there differences in factors of happiness based on different gender and marriage status?
```{r}
#Marital
str(happy$marital)
unique_marital_values <- unique(happy$marital)
print(unique_marital_values)

happy <- happy %>%
  mutate(marital_grouped = ifelse(marital %in% c("single", "separated", "divorced", "widowed"), "unmarried", "married"))

unique(happy$marital_grouped)
```

```{r}
#Gender and Marrige
happy_married_f <- happy[happy$gender=="f" & happy$marital_grouped=="married",]
happy_unmarried_f <- happy[happy$gender=="f" & happy$marital_grouped=="unmarried",]
happy_female <- happy[happy$gender=="f",]

bag_of_words_female <-  happy_female %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text)

word_count_female <- bag_of_words_female %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE)


temp <- bag_of_words_female %>%
  count(marital_grouped, word) %>%
  group_by(marital_grouped) %>%
  mutate(proportion = n / sum(n)) %>% 
  select(-n) %>% 
  spread(marital_grouped, proportion)
ggplot(temp, 
       aes_string(x = colnames(temp)[2], y = colnames(temp)[3]),
       color = abs(colnames(temp)[3] - colnames(temp)[2])) +
  geom_abline(color = "gray40", lty = 2) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.1, size = 1, width = 0.3, height = 0.3) +
  labs(title="Words Proportion for females married/unmarried")+
  geom_text(aes(label = word), check_overlap = TRUE, vjust = 1.5) +
  scale_x_log10(labels = percent_format()) +
  scale_y_log10(labels = percent_format()) +
  scale_color_gradient(limits = c(0, 0.001), low = "darkslategray4", high = "gray75") +
  theme(legend.position="none")
```

```{r}
happy_married_m <- happy[happy$gender=="m" & happy$marital_grouped=="married",]
happy_unmarried_m <- happy[happy$gender=="m" & happy$marital_grouped=="unmarried",]
happy_male <- happy[happy$gender=="m",]

bag_of_words_male <-  happy_male %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text)

word_count_male <- bag_of_words_male %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE)

temp <- bag_of_words_male %>%
  count(marital_grouped, word) %>%
  group_by(marital_grouped) %>%
  mutate(proportion = n / sum(n)) %>%
  select(-n) %>%
  spread(marital_grouped, proportion)

ggplot(temp, 
       aes_string(x = colnames(temp)[2], y = colnames(temp)[3]),
       color = abs(colnames(temp)[3] - colnames(temp)[2])) +
  geom_abline(color = "gray40", lty = 2) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.1, size = 1, width = 0.3, height = 0.3) +
  geom_text(aes(label = word), check_overlap = TRUE, vjust = 1.5) +
  labs(title="Words proportion for males married/unmarried")+
  scale_x_log10(labels = percent_format()) +
  scale_y_log10(labels = percent_format()) +
  scale_color_gradient(limits = c(0, 0.001), low = "darkslategray4", high = "gray75") +
  theme(legend.position="none")
```

Also, we could take a look at separate word clouds.
```{r}
bag_of_words_married_f <-  happy_married_f%>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text)

word_count_married_f <- bag_of_words_married_f %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE)

bag_of_words_unmarried_f <-  happy_unmarried_f %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text)

word_count_unmarried_f <- bag_of_words_married_f %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE)


wordcloud(word_count_married_f$word,word_count_married_f$n ,
          scale=c(3,0.1),
          max.words=100,
          min.freq=1,
          random.order=FALSE,
          rot.per=0.3,
          use.r.layout=T,
          random.color=FALSE,
          colors=brewer.pal(9,"Oranges"))

wordcloud(word_count_unmarried_f$word,word_count_unmarried_f$n ,
          scale=c(3,0.1),
          max.words=100,
          min.freq=1,
          random.order=FALSE,
          rot.per=0.3,
          use.r.layout=T,
          random.color=FALSE,
          colors=brewer.pal(9,"Oranges"))
```
- It seems that married women mentioned 'husband', 'son', 'daughter', 'friend', 'family' a lot, which are all related to their family member. According to the word cloud, we can conclude that time with family members is the main factor of married women.

```{r}
bag_of_words_married_m <-  happy_married_m %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text)

word_count_married_m <- bag_of_words_married_m %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE)

bag_of_words_unmarried_m <-  happy_unmarried_m %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text)

word_count_unmarried_m <- bag_of_words_unmarried_m %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE)

wordcloud(word_count_married_m$word,word_count_married_m$n ,
          scale=c(3,0.1),
          max.words=100,
          min.freq=1,
          random.order=FALSE,
          rot.per=0.3,
          use.r.layout=T,
          random.color=FALSE,
          colors=brewer.pal(9,"Blues"))

wordcloud(word_count_unmarried_m$word,word_count_unmarried_m$n ,
          scale=c(3,0.1),
          max.words=100,
          min.freq=1,
          random.order=FALSE,
          rot.per=0.3,
          use.r.layout=T,
          random.color=FALSE,
          colors=brewer.pal(9,"Blues"))
```

Similarly, the two words clouds above show that males with parenthood mention "daughter","son","wife" and "friend" a lot while males without parenthood mention "friend" most in their happy moments.

While the tendency of mentioning words are similar between men and women, the weights of mentioning might be different. We can take a look at the words frequency bar charts and examine the frequency of most mentioned words.
```{r}
word_count_married_f[1:15,] %>%
  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(word, n)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(title = "Word Frequency in Happy Moments for Married Female")+
  xlab(NULL) +
  ylab("Word Frequency")+
  coord_flip()

word_count_married_m[1:15,] %>%
  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(word, n)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(title ="Word Frequency in Happy Moments for Married Male")+
  xlab(NULL) +
  ylab("Word Frequency")+
  coord_flip()
```

- Conclusion: Both married men and women gain lots of happiness from their family members. Especially, the fact that married couples mention their wives and husbands the most is a notable result.


### Question 2. Happiness by age group
```{r}
cleaned_age <- na.omit(happy$age)
non_numeric_indices <- which(!grepl("^-?\\d*\\.?\\d+$", cleaned_age))
cleaned_age[non_numeric_indices] <- NA
numeric_age <- as.numeric(cleaned_age)
range(numeric_age)
```

Are the factors influencing happiness distinct across various age groups? I classify the entire population into five age categories: iGeneration (Teens & younger), Millennials (18 - 34 years old), Generation X (35 - 49 years old), Baby Boomers (50 - 69 years old), and Senior Citizens (70+ years old). Following this categorization, I create a contingency table to showcase the association between age groups and the types of happy moments experienced.

```{r}
happy <- happy[order(happy$age),]
happy <- happy[grepl("[0-9]{1,2}", happy$age),] # remove rows with invalid values
happy$age <- as.numeric(happy$age)
happy$age_group[happy$age < 18] <-  "iGeneration"
happy$age_group[happy$age < 35 & happy$age >= 18] <- "Millennial"
happy$age_group[happy$age < 50 & happy$age >= 35] <- "Generation X"
happy$age_group[happy$age < 70 & happy$age >= 50] <- "Baby Boomers"
happy$age_group[happy$age >= 70] <- "Senior Citizen"
Data_age_split <- split(happy, happy$age_group)
categorycount <- function(df){
  affection        <- sum(df$predicted_category == "affection")
  achievement      <- sum(df$predicted_category == "achievement")
  bonding          <- sum(df$predicted_category == "bonding")
  enjoy_the_moment <- sum(df$predicted_category == "enjoy_the_moment")
  leisure          <- sum(df$predicted_category == "leisure")
  exercise         <- sum(df$predicted_category == "exercise")
  nature           <- sum(df$predicted_category == "nature")
  return(c(affection,achievement,bonding,enjoy_the_moment,leisure,exercise,nature))
}
age.summatrix <- sapply(Data_age_split, categorycount)
rownames(age.summatrix) <- c("affection","achievement","bonding",
                             "enjoy_the_moment","leisure","exercise","nature") 
age.summatrix <- age.summatrix[,c("iGeneration","Millennial",
                                  "Generation X","Baby Boomers","Senior Citizen")]
age.summatrix
```

- Age indeed influences the factors contributing to people's happiness. Subsequently, I analyze the distribution of happiness categories across different age groups, presenting the proportions of sources of happiness in the table below.

##### Weight of each topic by different age groups
```{r}
categoryproportion <- function(df){
  affection        <- mean(df$predicted_category == "affection")
  achievement      <- mean(df$predicted_category == "achievement")
  bonding          <- mean(df$predicted_category == "bonding")
  enjoy_the_moment <- mean(df$predicted_category == "enjoy_the_moment")
  leisure          <- mean(df$predicted_category == "leisure")
  exercise         <- mean(df$predicted_category == "exercise")
  nature           <- mean(df$predicted_category == "nature")
  return(c(affection,achievement,bonding,enjoy_the_moment,leisure,exercise,nature))
}
age.propmatrix <- sapply(Data_age_split, categoryproportion)
rownames(age.propmatrix) <- c("affection","achievement","bonding",
                              "enjoy_the_moment","leisure","exercise","nature") 
age.propmatrix <- 
  age.propmatrix[,c("iGeneration","Millennial","Generation X",
                    "Baby Boomers","Senior Citizen")]
age.propmatrix
```

- Conclusion: It is evident that the percentages of "affection" and "nature" show a slight rise with age, whereas the percentages of "achievement" and "bonding" exhibit a slight decline as individuals age. This trend may be attributed to an increase in emotional focus and a slower pace of life with age. Consequently, individuals may become less concerned about career achievements and more invested in meaningful relationships. Additionally, there is a growing inclination to connect with nature and seek a more enriching environment. 

- The visual representation of these proportional changes is presented in the subsequent heatmap.

```{r}
age.heatmap <- heatmap(t(age.propmatrix),col = cm.colors(256), margins=c(10,5))
```


### Question 3. Is the happiness of individuals linked to their marital status when experiencing happy moments?
- In this section, I aim to present an alternative approach for conducting a comparative analysis between individuals in two marital statuses: married and single. I utilize bigrams to investigate the associations between words and create a network visualization of these bigrams. This enables the identification of distinct patterns in terms of frequency and sentiments.
```{r}
Data_marital <- merge(happy[,c("wid","text")],demo[,c("wid","marital")])
# join the processed happy moments dataset with country in demographic data
Data_marital <- Data_marital[Data_marital$marital%in%c("married","single"),
                             c("marital","text")]
```

 I focus solely on two marital statuses: married and single.- The bigram for married people’s happy moment words is as below:
```{r}
  marital_bigrams <- Data_marital %>%
  filter(marital=="married") %>% # picking out records where marital status is married
  unnest_tokens(bigram, text, token = "ngrams", n = 2)
bigrams_separated <- marital_bigrams %>%
  separate(bigram, c("word1", "word2"), sep = " ")
bigrams_filtered <- bigrams_separated %>% # remove uninteresting stop words
  filter(!word1 %in% stop_words$word) %>%
  filter(!word2 %in% stop_words$word)
bigram_counts <- bigrams_filtered %>% 
  count(word1, word2, sort = TRUE)
head(bigram_counts,15)
```

- The network graph for married people’s happy moment words is as below:
```{r}
  bigram_graph <- bigram_counts %>%
  filter(n > 100) %>%
  graph_from_data_frame()
a <- grid::arrow(type = "closed", length = unit(.15, "inches"))
ggraph(bigram_graph, layout = "fr") +
  geom_edge_link(aes(edge_alpha = n), show.legend = FALSE,
                 arrow = a, end_cap = circle(.07, 'inches')) +
  geom_node_point(color = "lightblue", size = 5) +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name), vjust = 1, hjust = 1) +
  theme_void()
```

- The bigram for single people’s happy moment words is as below:
```{r}
  marital_bigrams <- Data_marital %>%
  filter(marital=="single") %>% # picking out records where marital status is single
  unnest_tokens(bigram, text, token = "ngrams", n = 2)
bigrams_separated <- marital_bigrams %>%
  separate(bigram, c("word1", "word2"), sep = " ")
bigrams_filtered <- bigrams_separated %>% # remove uninteresting stop words
  filter(!word1 %in% stop_words$word) %>%
  filter(!word2 %in% stop_words$word)
bigram_counts <- bigrams_filtered %>% 
  count(word1, word2, sort = TRUE)
head(bigram_counts,15)
```

- The network graph for single people’s happy moment words is as below:
```{r}
  bigram_graph <- bigram_counts %>%
  filter(n > 100) %>%
  graph_from_data_frame()
a <- grid::arrow(type = "closed", length = unit(.15, "inches"))
ggraph(bigram_graph, layout = "fr") +
  geom_edge_link(aes(edge_alpha = n), show.legend = FALSE,
                 arrow = a, end_cap = circle(.07, 'inches')) +
  geom_node_point(color = "lightblue", size = 5) +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name), vjust = 1, hjust = 1) +
  theme_void()
```

- Conclusion: When comparing the two sets of output, it becomes evident that individuals experience increased pleasure from their family activities post-marriage. Married individuals tend to have a stronger focus on family, and the themes of their happiness are more likely to be associated with terms like 'mother,' 'daughter,' 'birthday,' etc. However, for people who are still single, they enjoy more personal time, resulting in a more colorful life. They can pursue personal hobbies such as 'walk the dog,' 'eat ice cream,' 'read a book,' 'eat delicious food,' 'buy a car,' 'play video games,' etc. They have fewer concerns and can enjoy more leisure when they are still single."


### Summary
1. Married individuals, both men and women, derive significant joy from their family members. It is particularly noteworthy that married couples frequently express the greatest happiness when referring to their spouses.

2. The observed shifts in proportions, including a slight increase in "affection" and "nature" with age and a decrease in "achievement" and "bonding" as individuals grow older, suggest a trend towards increased emotional focus, reduced emphasis on career achievements, and a heightened interest in meaningful relationships and connection with nature.

3. In comparing the two sets of output, it is observed that post-marriage, married individuals derive increased joy from family-oriented activities, while single individuals enjoy a more diverse and leisurely lifestyle with personal pursuits like walking the dog, reading, and engaging in various hobbies.
