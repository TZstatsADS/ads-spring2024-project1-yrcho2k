### [Project Description](doc/Proj1_desc.md)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2023

+ Project title: Is the happiness of individuals related to their marital status when experiencing happy moments?
+ This project is conducted by [Yerin Cho]

+ Project Summary: This document contains curated questions and answers to determine if factors of happiness are related to demographics, such as age, gender, or marriage status. Initially, I preprocessed the raw textual data, 'cleaned_hm.csv,' located in the data file, by cleaning the data, eliminating stopwords, and producing a refined version of the texts. The resulting output file stores the tidy version of the texts. Subsequently, I merged the processed text with demographic information from 'demographic.csv,' found in the data file, to create the dataset utilized in this report.

+ Three topics will be covered in this document which are:

1. Gender and Marriage.
2. Happiness by Age Group.
3. Age Group Associated with Marriage Status.
